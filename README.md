PROJECT APPRENTICE CHEF

**AIM**: Of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict revenue over the first year of each customer’s life cycle.

**WHY**: Client want to better understand how much revenue to expect from each customer within their first year of orders.

**BACKGROUND**: Apprentice Chef have come to realize that over 90% of their revenue comes from customers that have been ordering meal sets for 12 months or less.

**ASSUMPTION**: The dataset provided by the engineering team has used dataset engineering techniques and are statistically sound and represent the true picture of Apprentice Chef’s customers.

**Linear Regression Model**<br>
Using the sklearn linear model linear regression.
Fitting the model on the train data set X_train and y_train
Predicting the model on the test dataset X_test
Measuring the model performance by checking the model training score and testing score

**Result**<br>
Model training score is 0.752 i.e model predicted correct revenue 75% of the time on training dataset Model testing score is 0.712 i.e model predicted correct revenue 71% of the time on testing dataset

~~~
Training Score: 0.752
Testing Score: 0.712
